                            I don’t know why people are angry at PMB’s statement about lazy Nigerian youths. I don’t blame him because maybe some of
                            his acquaintances are lazy and uneducated. I am a Nigerian youth and I am not lazy. I am a Yoruba
                            boy and I am educated. I have never depended on Nigeria’s oil and I am living my dream. Read

                            ON day like this, exactly 57 years ago, Nigeria was on a festive and historic mood. It was the eve of October 1, 1960, the
                            day that the United Kingdom had set aside to grant Nigeria independence as a sovereign state.

                            largest on the continent in 2013, and it produces a large proportion of goods and services for
                            the West African subcontinent.[15] In addition, the debt-to-GDP ratio is 11 percent, which is
                            8 percent below the 2012 ratio.[16]

                        <p>The culture of Nigeria is shaped by Nigeria's multiple ethnic groups. The country has 527 languages,
                            seven of them are extinct.[1] Nigeria also has over 1150 dialects and ethnic groups. The six
                            largest ethnic groups are the Hausa and Fulani in the north, the Igbo in the southeast, and the
                            Yoruba predominate in the southwest, Efik - Ibibio, and Ijaw of the south.

                        <p>The Edo people are most frequent in the region between Yorubaland and Igboland. Many of the Edo tend
                            to be Christian. This group is followed[clarification needed] by the Ibibio/Annang/Efik people
                            of the coastal south southern Nigeria and the Ijaw of the Niger Delta.

                        <p>Nigeria's other ethnic groups, sometimes called 'minorities', are found throughout the country but
                            especially in the north and the middle belt. The traditionally nomadic Fulani can be found all
                            over West and Central Africa. The Fulani and the Hausa are predominantly Muslim while the Igbo
                            are predominantly Christian and so are the Efik, Ibibio, and Annang people. The Yoruba are equally
                            likely to be either Christian or Muslim. Indigenous religious practices remain important to all
                            of Nigeria's ethnic groups, and frequently these beliefs are blended with Christian beliefs,
                            a practice known as syncretism
